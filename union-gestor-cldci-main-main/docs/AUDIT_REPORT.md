---

### 7. Executive Committee Members Publicly Listed
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Risk**: Social engineering, targeting of influential members

---

### 8. Public Training/Course Data Without Authentication
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Risk**: Unauthorized data access, system abuse

**Issue**: Course, diploma, and module tables were publicly accessible.

**Fix Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Removed public access from `cursos`, `diplomados`, `modulos_diplomados`
- ‚úÖ Implemented authentication requirement for all training data
- ‚úÖ Public course discovery now requires user login

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING WARNINGS (Non-Critical)

The following 46 warnings remain but are **INTENTIONAL DESIGN CHOICES** for authenticated user access:

### Authentication-Based Access (43 warnings)
These tables correctly require authentication but are flagged by the linter because they allow access to authenticated users:

- Asambleas, Capacitaciones, Elecciones, Votos
- Organizaciones, User Roles, Profiles
- Delivery system tables (orders, routes, drivers, companies)
- Financial transactions, budgets
- Training enrollments, evaluations
- Audit logs (admin-only access)

**Status**: ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE - These require authentication and have proper role-based access control

### Infrastructure Warnings (3 warnings)
1. **OTP Expiry**: Exceeds recommended threshold
   - **Action Required**: User should adjust in Supabase settings
   
2. **Leaked Password Protection**: Currently disabled
   - **Action Required**: User should enable in Supabase Auth settings
   
3. **Postgres Version**: Security patches available
   - **Action Required**: User should upgrade Postgres version
